    This function returns a list of dictionaries, in which each dictionary
    represents one blob in the given 'searchvolume'. A blob is defined as 
    a set of connected points. The 'searchvolume' is expected to be a 
    p-dimensional Numpy array of zero and non-zero values. All neighboring
    non-zero values will be treated as connected points, i.e. a blob.
    
    Each blob dictionary in the list 'blobs' has the following entries:
        * blob['id'] - Number of blob in searchvolume, starting with 0
        * blob['points'] - List of points in this blob. Each point is a 1D Numpy array with p coordinates (one per dimension)
        * blob['offset'] - Offset from bounding box to global coordinate system
        * blob['boundingbox'] - Size of 3D box enclosing the entire blob
        * blob['volume'] - Number of voxels in blob
        * blob['CoM'] - Center of Mass (within bounding box)
        * blob['max_dist'] - Largest distance between any two points of blob
        * blob['characterization'] - Dict of further characterizations
        
    NB: The runtime of this function is largely independent of size of the 
    searchvolume, but grows with the number as well as the size of blobs.
    For busy 3D volumes, get_blobs_fast() can >100 times faster (but might
    falsly merge two almost-overlapping points in rare cases)
